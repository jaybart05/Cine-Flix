                Unique! Need to be present for the storyline it’s a thinkers and a visionaries movie. Very impressed
                with this Australian movie - never seen anything quite like it. Music was a real highlight as well as
                the fantastic acting from both main cast and the younger version actors. Loved seeing a strong female
                lead. What we need to see more of. We sure do produce some great talent here. I enjoyed this unique
                movie experience.

                delivers an intense blend of action and psychological tension, crafting a narrative that is as gripping

                experiences unexpected side effects that derail his mission. This premise sets the stage for a chaotic
                and suspenseful journey.

                This is a great movie. A dynamic cast and a stirring plot. The mystery is whether Gregory Peck is
                actually killed or was it an elaborate plot to make him a free man. As I saw him ride into the dawn of a
                new day I wondered if this was the pretense of a new life. This movie was made in the year I was born
                and it stands out as one of the greatest westerns I have ever seen.

                I thought this movie was very entertaining. The music alone made it one of my all time favorites. I wish
                it would be released on DVD. I think that Donald O'Conner and Jimmy Durante played off of each other
                very well. It always took me back to a simpler time and place to that perfect world we all wished we
                lived in.If your looking for a movie that takes you to a place that sums up 1950's milk and cookies life

                There were definitely certain parts that were decent scares. For a low budget short, the scares are shot
                and edited well. Keeps a good on edge tension throughout the movie. The plot could have been executed in
                a way that engaged the viewer more and added to the intensity. The ending was a little lackluster and
                could've benefited from a final scare. Good if you're looking for a short that will leave you a little
                creeped out and impressed with the level of scary you can reach in a 10 minute video. For what it is,
                it's definitely worth checking out and you'll likely get one or two good spooks...especially if you're
                not a regular horror watcher.

                her room and said "I heard it, too." It's used to very creepy effect here, as it's clearly an
                apparition, yet does such a convincing impression of her mother that she could be mistaken for her
                mother, except there's a subtle impression of threat in her voice that's delivered as though in

                following the roles they played in Charmed. I can certainly PRAISE the acting skills throughout the
                film, even the directing - but the plot...what happened? I am at a loss for words because I am still
                confused. I have to stay loyal to the actors who really did a good job considering the madness of the
